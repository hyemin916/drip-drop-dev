# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 introduces powerful features that make building web applications easier and more efficient. In this post, we'll explore the new App Router and how it simplifies routing in your applications.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

Next.js 14 brings several improvements:

- **Faster builds** with Turbopack
- **Server Actions** for simplified data mutations
- **Improved caching** strategies
- **Enhanced image optimization**

## App Router Benefits

The new App Router uses React Server Components by default, which means:

1. **Automatic code splitting** - Only load what you need
2. **Streaming SSR** - Faster page loads
3. **Simplified data fetching** - Use async/await directly in components

```typescript
// Example: Server Component
async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div>{post.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 is a game-changer for modern web development. The App Router simplifies many common patterns and improves performance out of the box.
