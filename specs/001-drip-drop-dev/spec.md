## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: How should the post thumbnail image be determined? → A: Auto-generate from first image, with manual override option
- Q: How should the blog owner authenticate to access post creation/editing features? → A: Environment-based (no login UI, auth via config/env)
- Q: Should the About Me page content be editable as Markdown like posts? → A: Yes, same Markdown editor interface as posts
- Q: How should posts without images be displayed in the post list (no automatic thumbnail available)? → A: Display with a default/placeholder thumbnail image
- Q: Where should the blog name "Drip Drop Dev" be displayed prominently? → A: Both header and page title

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As the blog owner, I want to create and publish blog posts in Markdown format that any visitor can read. Posts should be organized by categories (일상/개발) with images and captions. Visitors should be able to browse all posts or filter by category, see thumbnails in the post list, and learn about me on a dedicated page. The blog should have a distinctive "Drip Drop" themed design that maintains excellent readability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am the blog owner and logged in, **When** I create a new post with Markdown content, images with captions, and select a category (일상 or 개발), **Then** the post is saved and appears in both the full post list and the selected category list with a thumbnail
2. **Given** I am any visitor (authenticated or not), **When** I browse to the blog, **Then** I can view the post list with thumbnails, filter by category (일상/개발/전체), read individual posts with properly rendered Markdown and captioned images
3. **Given** I am any visitor, **When** I navigate to the About Me page, **Then** I can read information about the blog owner
4. **Given** I am the blog owner, **When** I try to create or edit a post, **Then** only I have permission to do so (other users cannot write)
5. **Given** I am viewing a post with images, **When** the images are displayed, **Then** each image shows its caption below it

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a post contains images without captions?
- How should the system display very long Markdown content in the post list?
- What happens if a post is assigned to an invalid category?

## Notes for Planning Phase

**Identified Ambiguities Requiring Clarification:**
1. Authentication mechanism for blog owner
2. Behavior when non-owners try to access write interfaces
3. Thumbnail generation/selection method
4. Exact placement of blog name "Drip Drop Dev"
5. About Me page content format and editing interface
6. Specific readability metrics for design
7. Posts without thumbnail handling
8. Post list preview length for long content

**Design Considerations:**
- "Drip Drop" theme suggests water/liquid aesthetics (droplets, fluid animations, flowing layouts)
- Readability priority suggests clean typography, good contrast, appropriate spacing
- Balance needed between thematic design and content clarity

**Suggested Next Steps:**
1. Run `/clarify` to resolve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items
2. Define specific design guidelines for "Drip Drop" theme
3. Specify authentication and authorization details
4. Clarify thumbnail and image handling workflows
